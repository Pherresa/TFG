DESCRIPTION
	VisualOS is an "visual simulator of and operating system", that
	will help study and understand the way a real sistem works.

	It allows the user to insert processes in the running system,
	assigning them properties (memory usage, processing bursts, IO
	accesses) and VisualOS will dynamically show different graphical
	representations of each subsystem. It is also posible to select the
	algorithm to be used in each case.
